# College Scheduler
This is a fully-functioning College Scheduler created on Android Studio for Android devices. The app contains a course list, 
assignment tracker, exam list, and todo-list, all with logical features like edit, delete, and sort.

> [!Note]
> The version of Android Studio used in implementation was 2023.1.1 Patch 2, and all code was emulated on Google Pixel 2 and 3a.

The application features a *Room database* to preserve user data across sessions. To implement the Room database and its interaction with the 
user interface, we employed the ***Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)*** architecture.

> [!Important]
> There is no password recovery or password reset options available. When a username is assigned to a password, it must be accessed through that password.

A demo of the application is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2qFutJAriQ), using the Google Pixel 3a emulator.
